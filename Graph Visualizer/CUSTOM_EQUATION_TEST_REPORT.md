**🚨 CRITICAL BUG IDENTIFIED:**

The 3D equation type detection algorithm in `customEquationUtils.ts:45-55` is fundamentally flawed:

```typescript
// Current (BROKEN) logic:
export const determineGraphType = (variables: string[]): '2D' | '3D' => {
  const hasZ = variables.includes('z')  // ❌ WRONG: z is output, not input
  const commonParameterVars = ['t', 'u', 'v', 'theta', 'phi', 'r']
  const nonParameterVars = variables.filter(v => !commonParameterVars.includes(v))
  
  if (hasZ || nonParameterVars.length > 2) {
    return '3D'
  }
  return '2D'
}
```

**Problem:** 3D surface equations like `z = x² + y²` don't contain 'z' as a variable - 'z' is the **output**. The algorithm looks for 'z' in the inputs, but all 3D surface equations have form `z = f(x,y)` where inputs are `x,y`.

**All 3D tests failed with:**
- ❌ Type detection: Expected 3D, got 2D
- ❌ Equations treated as 2D despite having x,y inputs

## 🔧 Critical Issues & Recommendations

### 🚨 **Priority 1: CRITICAL BUG**
**Issue:** 3D type detection completely broken  
**Impact:** ALL 3D surface equations incorrectly classified as 2D  
**Fix Required:** Rewrite `determineGraphType()` logic:

```typescript
// RECOMMENDED FIX:
export const determineGraphType = (equation: string): '2D' | '3D' => {
  // Check if equation starts with 'z =' or contains 'z=' 
  if (equation.trim().toLowerCase().startsWith('z') && equation.includes('=')) {
    return '3D'
  }
  
  // Count input variables (excluding functions)
  const variables = extractVariables(equation)
  const inputVars = variables.filter(v => !['t', 'u', 'v'].includes(v))
  
  return inputVars.length >= 2 ? '3D' : '2D'
}
```

### ⚠️ **Priority 2: Domain Validation**
**Issues Found:**
- Logarithmic functions: 3 equations need positive argument validation
- Square root functions: 4 equations need non-negative validation  
- Division by zero: 1 equation needs zero-denominator handling
- Trigonometric discontinuities: 1 equation needs special handling

**Recommendation:** Implement domain-aware rendering with:
- Pre-evaluation domain checks
- Intelligent point sampling around singularities
- User warnings for restricted domains

### ⚠️ **Priority 3: Equation Format Support**
Current parser only supports `y = f(x)` format. Need support for:
- `z = f(x,y)` format (critical for 3D)
- Implicit equations: `f(x,y,z) = 0`
- Multiple equation systems (parametric)
